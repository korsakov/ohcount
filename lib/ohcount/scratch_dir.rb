    # If a block is passed to the constructor, the path to the created directory
    # will be yielded to the block. The directory will then be deleted
    # when this block returns.

    # Sample usage:
    #
    #   ScratchDir.new do |path|
    #     # Do some work in the new directory
    #     File.new( path + '/foobaz', 'w' ) do
    #       # ...
    #     end
    #   end # Scratch directory is deleted here
